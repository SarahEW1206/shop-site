NOTES/Questions:

Index.html - banner images are changed manual with dots.
Slidertest.html - found a script to run as an automatic slideshow, BUT:
	Can't get carousel script to run if it's placed in the script.js file. Only will run inline (in slidertest.html). 
[There are links @ the very bottom of each page to switch between the 2]


Somehow broke the active class styling on the gallery links. don't necessarily need it but would like to be able to fix it either way.


TO-DO:

- Add unique icons for the other nav items (kids, mens, womens, sale)
- refine @media requests
- Fix content in "latest news" (righthand side lower portion)


Have incorporated:
• svgs
• js for carousel
• js for featured product (clicking link changes image)
• Flexbox (nav and also "lower portion")


Later: 
- Add a product page template
