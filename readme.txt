NOTES/Questions:


TO-DO:
- Fix content in "latest news" (righthand side lower portion)
- additional product page content (descriptions, etc.)
- Figure out why deployed version isn't recognizing the a tag in the template.html files, while local is working fine.


Have incorporated:
• svgs
• js for carousel
• js for featured product (clicking link changes image)
• Flexbox (nav and also "lower portion")
• Angular/component galleries
